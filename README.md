# DIYWindows
Utilizing `CGSInternal` and `GraphicsServices` for macOS (both great projects from @CodaFi),
this is a quick demo as to what is possible - a completely native non-Cocoa window with
a `CALayer`-backing, that supports all typical interaction. Lots must be done if one wishes to
turn this into something like a `UIView`, however. There are a few bugs - see if you can fix them!
